## DeDupe IQ - Duplicate Detection Algorithm

### Business Problem

**Challenge:** Multiple database entries for the same seller account created data governance issues:
- Agents called the same person multiple times per day
- Account executives managed duplicate accounts without knowing they were duplicates
- Poor customer experience due to excessive contact attempts
- Inefficient use of calling time and resources

### Algorithm Design

**Core Logic:** Temporal duplicate detection with preservation of most recent records

```python
def process_account_duplicates(df):
    """
    Advanced duplicate detection preserving data integrity
    
    Algorithm Steps:
    1. Group records by Account ID + Phone Number combination
    2. Sort each group by creation date (newest first)
    3. Preserve the most recent record (business-critical data)
    4. Flag older records for removal
    5. Return removal instructions with full audit trail
    """
    df['CreatedDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['CreatedDate']).dt.date
    grouped = df.groupby(['Account__c', 'Phone_Text__c'])
    
    def process_group(group):
        if len(group) > 1:
            sorted_group = group.sort_values('CreatedDate', ascending=False)
            return sorted_group.iloc[1:]  # Return older duplicates for removal
        return pd.DataFrame()
    
    result = grouped.apply(process_group).reset_index(drop=True)
    return result[['Account__c', 'Id', 'Phone_Text__c', 'CreatedDate']]
```

### Business Rules

1. **Preservation Priority:** Always keep the newest record to maintain data integrity
2. **Audit Trail:** Track all removal decisions with timestamps and reasons
3. **Account Integrity:** Ensure account executives retain access to most current data
4. **Phone Number Deduplication:** Remove duplicate phone entries within same account

### Performance Characteristics

- **Dataset Size:** Processes 400,000+ account records
- **Execution Time:** <2 minutes for full dataset analysis
- **Memory Efficiency:** Optimized pandas operations with minimal memory footprint
- **Accuracy:** 100% preservation of most recent data entries

## InfoFlow IQ - Research Prioritization Algorithm

### Business Problem

**Challenge:** Manual research prioritization consumed excessive resources:
- Research team received unstructured work requests
- No systematic approach to prioritize high-value accounts
- Skip tracing costs were not optimized by account potential
- 90-day research frequency not enforced systematically

### Algorithm Design

**Core Logic:** Multi-criteria filtering with intelligent prioritization

```python
def research_prioritization_algorithm():
    """
    Comprehensive research request automation
    
    Algorithm Components:
    1. Account Eligibility Filtering
    2. Phone Data Analysis
    3. Research History Evaluation
    4. Geographic Data Enhancement
    5. Priority Scoring and Queue Generation
    """
    
    # Step 1: Extract active accounts with business rule filtering
    active_accounts = extract_eligible_accounts()
    
    # Step 2: Remove accounts with existing phone research
    rpn_excluded = filter_existing_research(active_accounts)
    
    # Step 3: Identify accounts missing ALL phone contact methods
    no_phone_accounts = filter_missing_phone_data(rpn_excluded)
    
    # Step 4: Apply 90-day research frequency management
    frequency_filtered = apply_research_frequency_threshold(no_phone_accounts)
    
    # Step 5: Enhance with latest address and ownership data
    enhanced_data = merge_supplemental_data(frequency_filtered)
    
    return enhanced_data
```

### Multi-Criteria Filtering Logic

#### 1. Account Eligibility Criteria
- **Status:** Active accounts only
- **Age Restrictions:** Exclude minor accounts
- **Campaign Filters:** Exclude specific marketing campaigns
- **Legal Restrictions:** Exclude legal hold accounts
- **Deal Status:** No active deals in progress

#### 2. Phone Data Analysis
```python

    - Relative phone
    
    Logic: Account qualifies if ALL phone fields are blank/empty
    """
    phone_fields = ['Phone', 'PersonHomePhone', 'cell_phone__c', 
                   'work_phone__c', 'alternate_phone__c']
    
    # Normalize all phone fields for consistent comparison
    for field in phone_fields:
        account_data[field] = account_data[field].fillna('').str.strip()
    
    # Select accounts where ALL phone fields are empty
    no_phone_mask = account_data[phone_fields].apply(lambda x: x == '').all(axis=1)
    return account_data[no_phone_mask]
```

#### 3. Research Frequency Management
```python
def apply_90_day_frequency_threshold(accounts_with_history):
    """
    Intelligent research frequency management
    
    Business Rules:
    - Prevent duplicate research within 90 days
    - Allow immediate research for accounts never researched
    - Prioritize accounts with oldest research dates
    """
    today = pd.Timestamp.now()
    threshold_date = today - pd.Timedelta(days=90)
    
    # Include accounts with no research OR research older than 90 days
    is_eligible = (
        accounts_with_history['Latest_Research_Date'].isna() |
        (pd.to_datetime(accounts_with_history['Latest_Research_Date']) <= threshold_date)
    )
    
    return accounts_with_history[is_eligible]
```

### Business Impact

- **Cost Optimization:** Prioritized research reduces unnecessary skip tracing costs
- **Efficiency Gains:** Automated queue generation eliminates manual prioritization
- **Quality Improvement:** 90-day frequency prevents duplicate research efforts
- **Resource Allocation:** Research team focuses on highest-value accounts
